Hi Fellow Johnny Test Lovers!


   Ashton here, and if you are wondering, I do infact like Marvel's Infinity War. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over the typical viewer's head. There's also Thanos' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Marvel Comics. And yes, I do have an Infinity War tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then, they have to demonstrate that they are within 5 IQ points of my own beforehand.
